Okay, so I need to help summ^[[1;2Darize what happened at the AWS Cloud Day Philippines - AI Edition. From what I understand, it's a tech event where businesses and leaders learn about cloud services and AI. The user has provided some documents with details from the event.

First, there are speakers mentioned like Secretary Amenah F. Pangandaman, Precious Lim, Ana A. Delgado, Pasquale DeMaio, Jeff Johnson, Carl Cruz, Third Librea, Maria Francesca Del Rosar, Searc (maybe a typo for Sea), and so on. They are all from AWS or related companies in the Philippines.

The event also mentions platinum sponsors like ClickHouse, e-cloude valley, Tookitaki, monday.com, VSTECS, and some silver sponsors such as 1CloudHub, OGISphilippines, Couchbase, etc. These sponsors probably provided insights into their products and how they use AWS in their solutions.

In the event summary, there are bullet points about what was learned from different vendors like UnionBank using AWS for EKYC systems, Globel Telecom using AI for predicting 5G viability, Paymaya using AI to detect fraud, etc. These points highlight the practical applications of AWS and AI across various industries in the Philippines.

The user's goal is to summarize this event in a cute, first-person narrative with a female accent, making sure all key points are covered. I should structure it by introducing the event, mentioning the speakers, highlighting major takeaways from the vendors' insights, and ending on an encouraging note about AWS's potential for AI applications.

I need to ensure that each point is concise and flows well, avoiding too much technical jargon so it's accessible but still informative. Also, I should keep the tone upbeat and positive, reflecting excitement about the event's outcomes.

It was a fantastic day at AWS Cloud Day Philippines! The event was packed with insights from AWS speakers like Secretary Amenah F. Pangandaman and Carl Cruz, who shared how AI is transforming the Philippines' tech landscape. From UnionBank using AWS for EKYC systems to Globel Telecom leveraging AI for 5G predictions, the vendors demonstrated the power of cloud solutions in driving innovation.

I learned that companies are embracing AWS as a strategic partner rather than building from scratch. Paymaya and GCASH are already flexing their AI capabilities, like UnionBank's EKYC system and Globel Telecom's predictive analytics. Even though the Philippines is still catching up on AI adoption, it's clear there's a growing enthusiasm for using AWS to power smarter applications.

This event was just the beginning! The future of AI is bright, and I'm excited to see how we can continue pushing boundaries together with AWS. Let's build the future with cloud solutions and AI!
